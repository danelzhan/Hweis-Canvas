# Hwei's Canvas
<p>A game inspired by the champion Hwei from League of Legends, who paints his magic into the game. I wanted to create an adventure game that implemented similar mechanics, since there aren't many games that have tried it (was really sad Hogwarts Legacy didn't have it). <br>Anyways, currently a work-in-progress, please let me know if you have any suggestions or want to chat!</p>
